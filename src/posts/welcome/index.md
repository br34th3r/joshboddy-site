So I got a bit bored of the old site...

So I made a new one. I inititally started out attempting it with Next JS on a recommendation but gradually just found it more and more finnicky to add some things that were implemented simplistically in Gatsby. I think I'm starting to form a preference here.

I built this using a couple of gatsby plugins, including:

- gatsby-plugin-transition-link
- gatsby-transformer-remark
- gatsby-source-github-api
- gatsby-plugin-sass

It ended up working a lot more effectively for me than trying to write everything from scratch. So what there's a bit of a build time? It's all static at the end right?

Either way, have a look around, admire the particle effects on the page and make sure to get in touch to let me know what you think.

Signing off
